## Description

A Pokemon TCG card collection tracker with an emphasis on labelling your most sought-after (grailed) cards.

## Purpose 

This was a quick web app I developed for the purpose of learning Flask (and coding something for fun). Admittedly, the overall design and implementation of many features in this project are quite rushed and not well thought out, however, I have plans of re-writing this project with much more care in the near future (like later this week or so). 

## Closing Thoughts
Overall, Flask is a pretty simple framework to use for writing small apps like this, but I dislike Jinja2, and I felt that it would have been much more convenient to have written the entire thing in Javascript.
